## The impact of economy in the digital and non-digital environment. 
Now digital platforms are recasting the relationships between customer, workers, companies and so on. As computing power improves dramatically and more and more people around the world starts to participate in the digital and non-digital economy which generates more changes. 

Indeed, the impact of digital is visible everywhere, from accessing essential services and purchasing products from different websites such Amazon, AliExpress among others. 
In fact, the impact generated in the economy by these aspects is not only limited from the perspective of digital economy as well as non-digital economy, but also in how it affects both. 

 From a general perspective it affects in many areas such economic growth, for example when producers and consumer use digital inputs - that belongs to digital technologies and infrastructure to digital services and data – in all activities that can affect digital economy or non-digital economy, for example when it impacts in the GDP, the SME Development among others.
 
However, in this case, we will focus on the following sections from a general perspective. 

### The impact in Economy by AI uses. 
Artificial Intelligence now have a profound impact on the digital and not digital business as well as in both aspects of the economy.

When it comes to focus in how IA can impact these aspects, we can first consider to the organization that take this approach will and have been scoring quick wins, generate value faster and most important achieve long-term success even more times than organization that do not make use of it. 

Many enterprises consider the negative aspect of the implementation cost and complexity that the use of IA has. But it can help them to improve.
If you do a look around the world and business now, it is easy to realize that digital leaders across a variety of industries are moving beyond the experimentation to integrate AI into their business operations. 

In fact, making use of the IA starts with the understanding that this has the power and potential of improve their business, create more agility in the business process, know their customer and active new revenue channels, which from many aspects affect the economy of the world from the two aspects. 

Now IA becomes the boost in productivity, deliver new product and services, corporate values among others, for example it has allowed firms to address challenges from vision and speech to prediction and diagnosis which at the end can be reduced to reduce cost, and improve profits or develop strategies for the companies that can affect the economy from a physical perspective or digital. 

Some examples of how the IA has become the mainstream in efficiency and productivity gains are how the “General Electric” has made use of it to transform itself into a “digital powerhouse” with a $7 billion in software sales. Other one if the case of “German Automaker” that makes use of the “smart sedan” that uses AI to drive itself autonomously, and last in medicine, where McGill university have developed a computer-driven algorithm that can predict Alzheimer’s progressing that can help to reduce cost and reduce the time to detect it. 

### The impact in Economy by Automation and augmentation of work with Machine Learning Algorithms. 
As we have mentioned before, IA has an important role in the actual time, and it affect economy in many ways. Due this fact, is when new conventions and new technological developments such as machine learning algorithms comes to play an important role. 

Here is when comes to think about if a product, services, or anything else that makes use of machine learning algorithm needs to be focused on augmentation or automation. If fact “automation implies that machines take over a human task, augmentation means that humans collaborate closely with machines to perform a task”. 

In general, the impact in the economy digital and non-digital with this, is focused on the aspect of performance. For example, in automation, it has the side effect that when a business’s makes use of it only, their economy in any aspect will only have short term benefits. In addition, it increases the speed of tasks, the accuracy, reduces the repetition and makes many things scalable. In general, it is possible to summarize it as: Reduce the cost of production, reduces the amount of job for people which has an impact in the personal economy, and that consequently affect other aspects.

Other impacts that it can have in both aspects is that it could lead to the creation of super firms – hubs of wealth and knowledge – that could have detrimental effects on the wider economy. It may also widen the gap between developed and developing countries and boost the need for workers with certain skills while rendering others redundant; this latter trend could have far-reaching consequences for the labor market.
