## The impact of economy in the digital and non-digital environment. 
Now digital platforms are recasting the relationships between customer, workers, companies and so on. As computing power improves dramatically and more and more people around the world starts to participate in the digital and non-digital economy which generates more changes. 

Indeed, the impact of digital is visible everywhere, from accessing essential services and purchasing products from different websites such Amazon, AliExpress among others. 
In fact, the impact generated in the economy by these aspects is not only limited from the perspective of digital economy as well as non-digital economy, but also in how it affects both. 

 From a general perspective it affects in many areas such economic growth, for example when producers and consumer use digital inputs - that belongs to digital technologies and infrastructure to digital services and data – in all activities that can affect digital economy or non-digital economy, for example when it impacts in the GDP, the SME Development among others.
 
However, in this case, we will focus on the following sections from a general perspective. 

### The impact in Economy by AI uses. 
Artificial Intelligence now have a profound impact on the digital and not digital business as well as in both aspects of the economy.

When it comes to focus in how IA can impact these aspects, we can first consider to the organization that take this approach will and have been scoring quick wins, generate value faster and most important achieve long-term success even more times than organization that do not make use of it. 

Many enterprises consider the negative aspect of the implementation cost and complexity that the use of IA has. But it can help them to improve.
If you do a look around the world and business now, it is easy to realize that digital leaders across a variety of industries are moving beyond the experimentation to integrate AI into their business operations. 

In fact, making use of the IA starts with the understanding that this has the power and potential of improve their business, create more agility in the business process, know their customer and active new revenue channels, which from many aspects affect the economy of the world from the two aspects. 

Now IA becomes the boost in productivity, deliver new product and services, corporate values among others, for example it has allowed firms to address challenges from vision and speech to prediction and diagnosis which at the end can be reduced to reduce cost, and improve profits or develop strategies for the companies that can affect the economy from a physical perspective or digital. 

Some examples of how the IA has become the mainstream in efficiency and productivity gains are how the “General Electric” has made use of it to transform itself into a “digital powerhouse” with a $7 billion in software sales. Other one if the case of “German Automaker” that makes use of the “smart sedan” that uses AI to drive itself autonomously, and last in medicine, where McGill university have developed a computer-driven algorithm that can predict Alzheimer’s progressing that can help to reduce cost and reduce the time to detect it. 

### The impact in Economy by Automation and augmentation of work with Machine Learning Algorithms. 
As we have mentioned before, IA has an important role in the actual time, and it affect economy in many ways. Due this fact, is when new conventions and new technological developments such as machine learning algorithms comes to play an important role. 

Here is when comes to think about if a product, services, or anything else that makes use of machine learning algorithm needs to be focused on augmentation or automation. If fact “automation implies that machines take over a human task, augmentation means that humans collaborate closely with machines to perform a task”. 

In general, the impact in the economy digital and non-digital with this, is focused on the aspect of performance. For example, in automation, it has the side effect that when a business’s makes use of it only, their economy in any aspect will only have short term benefits. In addition, it increases the speed of tasks, the accuracy, reduces the repetition and makes many things scalable. In general, it is possible to summarize it as: Reduce the cost of production, reduces the amount of job for people which has an impact in the personal economy, and that consequently affect other aspects.

Other impacts that it can have in both aspects is that it could lead to the creation of super firms – hubs of wealth and knowledge – that could have detrimental effects on the wider economy. It may also widen the gap between developed and developing countries and boost the need for workers with certain skills while rendering others redundant; this latter trend could have far-reaching consequences for the labor market.

### The impact in Economy of Big Data and Cloud Computing.
These days. Big data and Cloud have an important role. Big data has three characteristics. The first one is Volume, that big data is created in large volumes. Variety, which is that big data have variety like images, videos among other types and last velocity, which focus on how fast the data grows. <br>
In the case of cloud computing, it can be summarized in the following characteristics: resources pooling, On-demand self-service, easy maintenance, economical, security, resiliency, and availability among others. Last, it is provided in the services of IaaS, PaaS, SaaS and BPO. <br>

In general, these have become crucial in extending financial development into new sectos in the wake of the global financial crisis. These services have significant and positive impact on the economy and financial results of business. This is because has the capacity to adapt, reduce cost, competitiveness, and last the increase of profitability and efficiency. <br>

### Other technologies as Blockchain and hyperledger
The society never ends to change and improve, this is the example of the Blockchain. From a general perspective it is a shared, unalterable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions and tracking assets inside a business network. This include the fact that the asset can be tangible or intangible. <br>

Due this fact, many enterprises have created services using this technologies, one example of them is Hyperledger which is a global enterprise blockchain project that offers the necessary framework, standards, guidelines, and tools to build open source blockchains. <br>

The blockchain affect economy in the scenario and a potential future in which the cryptocurrency could replaces current monetary systems (Payments and even financial services). In addition, other impact can be in the economy of the public sectors, education or even healthcare, in which capitalizing on the efficiencies blockchain will bring the word of identity and credential that will save money, and that could satisfy the demand of many aspects. <br>

### Financial Transactions
In general, the transactions can be understood as “a completed agreement between a buyer and a seller to exchange goods, services or financial assets in return for money”. <br>

In general, the financial transactions need to boost security for the cash. In this case, from a general perspective it impacts the economy in both aspects to reduce operational costs. All of this depends on the fact that higher transactions costs on the cost of capital is likely to be very small and the impact of small changes in the cost of capital have no noticeable impact on investment. So, it improves economy making it increase the profits and reduce the cost. <br>

### Digital Currencies
The digital currency in general can be understood as a form of currency that is available only in digital or electronic form. It is called also digital money, electronic money among others. <br>

This gives other relational term, which is the cryptocurrency, which is a virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double spend. Many of these are based on the blockchain. Some examples of these are Ethereum, Litecoin, Cardano, Polkadot among others. <br>

These digital currencies have an impact in digital and non-digital economy that many of us have not realized. For example, one impact is the reduction of cash, like the cost of moving physical money from one location to another and the security costs associates with it. It also impacts in the easy of flow of money between government and individual. In addition, it allows to have more transparency for informal economy. Other impacts are the accelerate of financial inclusion, increase the use of E-commerce, monetary policy assistance among others. <br>

### Technical Obstacles and Political Challenges
The rapid spread of digital technologies has made a revolution for individuals as well as firms, changing all. Nevertheless, such changes also entail significant challenges for the State as it has to regulate activities that previously did not exist or for which the current legislation is not appropriate. <br>

For example, new digital technologies have opened the door to competition. However, the disruptive appearance of new agents can also lead to unfair competition. Another important issue is a consumer protection legislation and quality and safety standards that sometimes are not efficient and have a lack of aspects to consider. <br>

One example was the case of El Salvador where the country adopted the legal tender of the bitcoin but that only a fraction of the central American nation’s businesses has taken a bitcoin payment and technical problems have plagued the government’s cryptocurrency. <br>

One consequence was that people lost money when they tried to withdraw cash, but it was no possible and they lost their money. Other problems were the irregularities with transactions and attempts of stolen identity. This is only one example of many other technical obstacles. <br>
